# -Number-Guessing-Game
Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based game written in C++. In this game, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess the correct number. With each guess, the program will provide hints indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The game keeps track of the number of attempts taken by the player to guess the correct number.

Features

Input validation to ensure only numbers are accepted.
Clear feedback provided after each guess (whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct).
Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the number.
Robust error handling for non-numeric inputs, prompting the player to enter valid guesses.
How to Play
